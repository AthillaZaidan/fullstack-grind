# Project: Admin Dashboard - Progress Log

This document summarizes the development progress of the Admin Dashboard project.

## 1. Initial Setup & Analysis
- The project began with a basic HTML file (`index.html`), an empty stylesheet (`src/styles.css`), and an empty script file (`src/script.js`).
- The goal was established: to build a dashboard UI based on the provided inspiration image (`src/img/Inspiration/inspiration.png`).

## 2. Core Layout Construction
- The HTML structure was built out to include a sidebar (`<aside>`) and a main content area (`<main>`).
- CSS Grid was used to create the primary two-column layout, with a fixed-width sidebar on the left and a flexible main content area on the right.

## 3. Statistics Cards
- The four main statistics cards (Total Users, Revenue, etc.) were added to the HTML.
- CSS was written to style these cards, including their background color, padding, and rounded corners.
- Placeholder icons were replaced with appropriate SVGs for each card.

## 4. Chart Implementation with Chart.js
- An HTML section for charts was created, containing two `<canvas>` elements for the line and pie charts.
- The **Chart.js** library was added to the project via a CDN link in `index.html`.
- JavaScript was written in `src/script.js` to:
    - Initialize a "Quarterly Revenue" line chart.
    - Initialize a "Source Breakdown" pie chart.
    - Configure both charts with data, colors, and options to match the inspiration image.

## 5. Layout Refinements
- The CSS for the chart section was adjusted to control the layout. The final implementation uses a `1fr 1fr` grid to make the chart cards equal width.
- The `maintainAspectRatio: false` option was added to the chart configurations in JavaScript. This was a key change to prevent the charts from becoming too tall and to allow them to fit neatly within their rectangular card containers.

## 6. Responsive Design
- The HTML for the chart section was refactored for better semantics and consistency.
- **CSS Media Queries** were added to `src/styles.css` to handle smaller screen sizes (max-width: 768px).
- The responsive styles achieve the following:
    - The main layout stacks into a single column, placing the sidebar above the main content.
    - The header content stacks vertically.
    - The charts section stacks into a single column, placing the pie chart below the line chart.

The project is now fully styled to match the inspiration image and is responsive for tablet and mobile devices.
